  "rationale": "High blood pressure (HBP), also known as hypertension, is when the pressure in blood vessels is higher than normal (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2016). The causes of hypertension are multiple and multifaceted and can be based on genetic predisposition, environmental risk factors, being overweight and obese, sodium intake, potassium intake, physical activity, and alcohol use. High Blood Pressure is common, according to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), approximately 85.7 million adults >= 20 years of age had HBP (140/90 mm Hg) between 2011 to 2014 (Crim, 2012. Between 2011-2014 the prevalence of hypertension (>=140/90 mm Hg) among US adults 60 and older was approximately 67.2 percent (Benjamin et al., 2017). \n\nHBP, known as the “silent killer,” increases risks of heart disease and stroke which are two of the leading causes of death in the U.S. (Yoon, Fryar, & Carroll, 2015). A person who has HBP is four times more likely to die from a stroke and three times more likely to die from heart disease (CDC, 2012) The National Vital Statistics Systems Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that in 2014 there were approximately 73,300 deaths directly due to HBP and 410,624 deaths with any mention of HBP (CDC, 20145).Between 2004 and 2014 the number of deaths due to HBP rose by 34.1 percent (Benjamin et al., 2017). Managing and treating HBP would reduce cardiovascular disease mortality for males and females by 30.4 percent and 38.0 percent, respectively (Patel et al., 2015).\n\nThe estimated annual average direct and indirect cost of HBP from 2012 to 2013 was $51.2 billion (Benjamin et al., 2017). Total direct costs of HBP is projected to increase to $200 billion by 2030 (Benjamin et al., 2017). A study on cost-effectiveness on treating hypertension found that controlling HBP in patients with cardiovascular disease and systolic blood pressures of >=160 mm Hg could be effective and cost-saving (Moran et al., 2015). \n\nMany studies have shown that controlling high blood pressure reduces cardiovascular events and mortality. The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) investigated the impact of obtaining a SBP goal of <120 mm Hg compared to a SBP goal of <140 mm Hg among patients 50 and older with established cardiovascular disease and found that the patients with the former goal had reduced cardiovascular events and mortality (SPRINT Research Group et al., 2015). \n\nControlling HBP will significantly reduce the risks of cardiovascular disease mortality and lead to better health outcomes like reduction of heart attacks, stroke, and kidney disease (James et al., 2014). Thus, the relationship between the measure (control of hypertension) and the long-term clinical outcomes listed is well established.",
  "clinicalRecommendationStatement": "The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (2015) recommends  screening for high blood pressure in adults age 18 years and older. This is a grade A recommendation. \n\nAmerican College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (2017)\n-For adults with confirmed hypertension and known CVD or 10-year ASCVD event risk of 10% or higher, a blood pressure target of less than 130/80 mmHg is recommended\n-For adults with confirmed hypertension, without additional markers of increased CVD risk, a blood pressure target of less than 130/80 mmHg may be reasonable (Note: clinical trial evidence is strongest for a target blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg in this population. However observational studies suggest that these individuals often have a high lifetime risk and would benefit from blood pressure control earlier in life)\n\nAmerican College of Physicians and the American Academy of Family Physicians (2017):  \n-Initiate intensifying pharmacologic treatment in adults aged 60 and older at high cardiovascular risk, based on individualized assessment, to achieve a target systolic blood pressure of less than 140 mmHg (Grade: weak recommendation, quality of evidence: low)\n-Initiate intensifying pharmacologic treatment in adults aged 60 and older with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack to achieve a target systolic blood pressure of less than 140 mmHg to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke (Grade: weak recommendation, quality of evidence: moderate)\n\nAmerican Diabetes Association (2018):\nMost patients with diabetes and hypertension should be treated to a systolic blood pressure goal of <140 mmHg and a diastolic blood pressure goal of <90 mmHg (Level of evidence: A)\n\nReport from the Eighth Joint National Committee (2014)\n-In the general population younger than 60 years, initiate pharmacologic treatment to lower blood pressure at diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 90 mmHg or higher and treat to a goal of DBP of lower than 90 mmHg (Grade: A (for ages 30-59), Grade: E (for ages 18-29))\n-In the general population younger than 60 years, initiate pharmacologic treatment to lower blood pressure at systolic blood pressure (SBP) to 140 mmHg or higher and treat to a goal of SBP of lower than 140 mmHg (Grade: E)\n-In the general population aged 60 years and older, initiate pharmacologic treatment to lower blood pressure at SBP of 150 mmHg or higher or a DBP of 90 mmHg or higher and treat to a goal of SBP lower than 150 mmHg and goal of DBP lower than 90 mmHg",
