APHL Chronic Disease Surveillance Implementation Guide

This implementation guide documents an approach to chronic disease surveillance using HL7 FHIR and standards-based infrastructure that minimizes provider implementation requirements. The approach aligns with and makes use of available reporting infrastructure and capacity from the Public Health electronic Case Reporting (eCR) and Clinical Quality Measure (CQM) use cases.
