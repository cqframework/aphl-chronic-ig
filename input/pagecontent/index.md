### Introduction

This implementation guide provides a demonstration of the use of existing
quality measurement and public health reporting infrastrcture to support the
chronic disease surveillance use case.

### Contents

* [Background](background.html): An overview of the use case and approach
* [Specification](specification.html): Technical specification of the approach
* [Artifacts](artifacts.html): The reporting specification resources

Note that implementations can make use of pre-bundled contents suitable for direct ingestion by the eCRNow application in the [bundles](https://github.com/cqframework/aphl-chronic-ig/tree/main/archive-2025/kars) directory of the source repository for this implementation guide.

### Feedback

This implementation guide is an open source community-driven effort to support providers, health information exchanges, and public health agencies explore the use of existing technologies to implement chronic disease surveillance and other reporting-related use cases. Feedback is welcome by submitting a [new issue](https://github.com/cqframework/aphl-chronic-ig/issues/new) to the source repository for this implementation guide.
